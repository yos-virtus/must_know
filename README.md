# DRY

# Keep it simple stupid
One of the most common mistakes especially when you are begginer is making things too generic. Writing code and functionaly for something that does not exist yet. Try to avoid that because disposition can change very quickly and things that you were aiming for when you wrote your generic code could be irrelevant tommorow. In that case the precious time and effort will be wasted for nothing. Only the tasks at hand.

# SOLID
  * __Single responsibility principle__
  Every object should be responsible only for one thing
  * __Open-closed principle__
  A software artifact should be open for extension but closed for modification.
  * __Lyskov substitution principle principle__
  Objects/classes in programm can be substituted by thier inherited objects/classes without changing the behaviour of the programm.
  As conterintuitive as it might sound but vertical inheritance is the weakest part of OOP. Lyskov substitution principle is all about that. You should be careful when you use base classes.
  * __Interface segregation principle__
  * __Dependency inversion principle__
